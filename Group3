What did I do over the summer? Overall, I didnâ€™t do many interesting things besides work. 
The only fun things I did was go to a few concerts and hang out with old high school friends. 
I made a lot of money from working 11 hrs/day, but sadly most of that was blown on 3 college books. 
I am quite happy to be back at college and plan on enjoying my final 1.5 years here.

I got to see LA and the surrounding area. I also did my fair share of working for most of the summer. This was
also the first summer I lived in Muncie.

Durring the summer I did several major things. 
First would be the online class that I took this was something that took a decent portion of time. 
Other than this I visited several friends and We went out to see people. 
Along with this I got into several video games and enjoyed the time I had playing with them. 
Once it started getting closer to the school year, I ended up going to Kings Island with my family as going away time with my brother.
As he is heading off to his first year of college in Colorado.
